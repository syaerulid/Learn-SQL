/*
DATE_TRUNC is a function in SQL that is used to truncate a date or timestamp value to a specified precision. 
The function returns a new date or timestamp value with all the values at a lower precision set to zero.

For example, if you have a timestamp value of "2022-04-01 13:45:30" and you want to truncate it to the hour precision, 
the resulting value would be "2022-04-01 13:00:00". The minutes and seconds have been truncated to zero, and only the hour value remains.
*/

Example :
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', order_timestamp_utc) AS hour,
    AVG(amount) as avg_vol
FROM postmates_orders
GROUP BY customer_id,order_timestamp_utc
ORDER BY avg_vol DESC
